# Today I Learned...

I'm going to try and share at least one thing that I learned. I'm going to shoot for posting more days than not, but we'll see how successful I am at that.

Principles to follow:

- Share literally anything I learned (tech, softskills, etc) in a public way with the hope that it helps someone else.
- Share what I learned in a consumable format such as 1-2 sentences, with links to more info if needed.

Now for what I've learned...ðŸ‘‡
